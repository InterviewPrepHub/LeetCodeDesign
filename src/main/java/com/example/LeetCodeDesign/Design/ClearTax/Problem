Design a system for facilitating hierarchical user access management as described below. The system should be capable of handling various tasks related to organizational hierarchy and user permissions.


Establishing an organizational hierarchy with a variable number of levels (N levels).
Defining various actions that users can undertake.
Assignment of permissions to users, allowing them to perform actions at specific hierarchy levels.
Implementing a cascading mechanism where permissions granted at higher levels extend to lower levels in the hierarchy.
Resolving permissions using three parameters: User, Level, and Permission. If the combined evaluation of these parameters is true, the user possesses the necessary permission to execute an action.

For instance, consider the independent hierarchy levels: L0, L1, L2
L1 has two lower levels : L1.1, L1.2
L2 has two lower levels : L2.1, L2.2
L2.1 has one lower level : L2.1.1

Here are some permission scenarios:
User U1 is granted permission P1 at level L1.
This implies that U1 holds P1 permission for all children of L1, including L1.1 and L1.2.
User U2 is granted permissions P1 and P2 at level L2.1.1.
User U3 is granted permission P1 at level L2 and permission P2 at level L2.1.1.
Consequently, U3 possesses P1 permission for levels L2, L2.1, L2.2, and L2.1.1.
However, U3 only has P2 permission at level L2.1.1.


Assignments
UI, P1, L1
U2, P1, L2.1.1
U2, P2, L2.1.1
U3, P1, L2
U3, P2, L2.1.1

Test Cases
{U1, P1, L1} = true
{U1, P1, L1.1.3} = true
{U1, P2, L1.3} = false
{U3, P2, L2} = false
